## Unreleased

## v0.1.0

Initial public test release.

### Added

- GitHub Actions firmware build workflow.
- Automated GitHub Releases for `v*` tags.
- Docker-based CI build environment.
- Release artifacts for `release-tmc` and `release-cdc` presets.
- SHA-256 checksum file for release artifacts.
- GitHub artifact attestations for release artifacts.
- Automated release notes grouped by pull request labels.
- Root `VERSION` file used as the default firmware version.

### Changed

- Firmware `*IDN?` version now comes from the build-time `FIRMWARE_VERSION`
  definition instead of a hardcoded SCPI value.
- Release builds created from Git tags use the tag value without the leading `v` as the firmware version.
